# DIP-MATLAB-Based-Quality-Assessment
Quality Assessment of  Object(Flower) By Using Digital Image Processing(MATLAB).



”Quality Assessment of Flower By Digital Image Processing(MATLAB)”
We developed a digital image processing system for live quality assessment of object(
flower) by filtering, coding, enhancement, restoration, feature extraction, analysis
and recognition of objects from image. We also design a Matlab based user interface
for accessing and manipulating output data which could further use for quality assessment.

The system has following modules:

1. Image Acquisition and Processing:
• Acquiring visual information and recognize objects from image.
• Improvement its appearance, re-sizing, filtering, cleaning, segmenting and
thresholding.

2. Morphological Processes:
• Used to perform Object extraction Image filtering operations.
• Morphological operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.

3. Canny Algorithm:
• Used this for detecting curve line segments(edge).
• Find out discontinuities and variations in surfaces and depth.

4. MATLAB:
• 2-D graphics functions for visualizing data and algorithm interaction.
• Interactive tool used for iterative exploration, design, and problem solving.
